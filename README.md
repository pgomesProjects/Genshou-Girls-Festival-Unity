  The game is an visual novel about a extraordinary student that goes to an academy with even more extraordinary people are her. While you get to read about a story of a young woman finding themselves in an unusual place, it also features the lives and developments of three other students: the blue skinned Azura Bell, the four armed Seiko Watanabe, and the mysterious Yasuda Nana.
  <br />
  During the story, you will occasionally get "Free Time", which allows you to roam around the school and get to know the environment of the supernatural world. Ultimately, the decisions that you make in the game matter, as the way you play will change your ending in various ways.
