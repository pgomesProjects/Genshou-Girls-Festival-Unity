  biography: "Holly is a young woman recently accepted to Hokkaido Ultra Dimensional
    Academy. She can phase through any physical object: walls, desks, and even floors.
    Due to the nature of the power being hard to maintain, she is classified as a
    Destructive. Society casts shame on Destructives for having such powers, treating
    them as lesser beings for it. Therefore, she\u2019s never had many people she
    would consider friends and occasionally gets stumped when trying to think about
    the right things to say. Despite her desire to hole up in her room for the foreseeable
    future, the scouts of HUDA and her mother have convinced her to at least give
    it a shot. To Holly, this opportunity will determine whether she finds a way
    to assimilate into society normally or cements her desire to shut herself from
    the world for the rest of her life."
